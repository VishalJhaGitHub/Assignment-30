    "#Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the features of a dataset. This type of statistics focuses on the measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations of data (histograms, box plots, scatter plots). Descriptive statistics are used to provide a summary of data in a clear and concise manner, and they help to identify patterns and trends in the data.\n",

    "#Inferential Statistics:\n",

    "#Inferential statistics are used to make generalizations or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This type of statistics involves the use of probability theory, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics are used to make predictions or draw conclusions about a population based on a limited sample of data.\n",
    "#Example: A healthcare researcher wants to determine whether a new drug is effective in reducing the symptoms of a particular disease. The researcher can use inferential statistics to analyze the results of a clinical trial and determine whether the drug is effective for the entire population, based on the results from a sample of participants. The researcher can use hypothesis testing to determine whether the results are statistically significant, and use regression analysis to identify which factors influence the effectiveness of the drug."

Measures of central tendency provide a summary of the central or typical value in a dataset, while measures of variability describe the spread or dispersion of the data points around the central tendency. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability and how they can be used to describe a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency as it provides an estimate of the \"typical\" value in a dataset. However, it can be sensitive to extreme values, which can skew the mean.\n",

    "#2 - Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from lowest to highest. If there is an even number of values in the dataset, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when there are extreme values or outliers in the dataset, as it is not affected by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 - Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is a useful measure of central tendency when there are multiple peaks in the data distribution or when the data are nominal or categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 - Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It is a simple measure of variability that provides an estimate of the spread of the data. However, it can be affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5 - Interquartile range (IQR): The IQR is the range of the middle 50% of the values in a dataset. It is calculated by subtracting the value at the 25th percentile from the value at the 75th percentile. The IQR is a useful measure of variability as it is not affected by extreme values or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6 - Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. It is a more complex measure of variability that provides a more accurate estimate of the spread of the data than the range. However, it is also affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7 - Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the spread of the data that is in the same units as the original data. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability as it is not affected by extreme values or outliers, and it can be used to assess the degree of variation from the mean."
